c-server
========
_Disclaimer: you shouldn't use this code in production, it contains some bugs even though I tried hard to avoid memory leaks_

Client/Server code to do remote function calls.

I did this project a long time ago, so I don't remember the gcc command to compile it. I used Xcode to modify it, test it and add some comments.
All you need to do is add pthread to the linker and make sure it knows that some header files are in lib.

I did this project in 1st year with my roommate Eric.s
